🚀 STEP-BY-STEP: Deploy Flask App to Render
✅ Step 1: Prep Your Flask Project Locally
Make sure your Flask project has:

css
Copy
Edit
/your-flask-app/
│
├── app.py             👈 your main Flask file (can be named anything)
├── requirements.txt   👈 list of all dependencies
├── Procfile           👈 tells Render how to run your app
├── templates/         👈 (if using HTML templates)
├── static/            👈 (for CSS, JS, images)
✅ Step 2: Create These 2 Important Files
📄 1. requirements.txt
Run this in terminal inside your project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
It captures all the installed libraries.

📄 2. Procfile (no extension)
Create a file named Procfile (just that word, no .txt or .py) with this content:

makefile
Copy
Edit
web: gunicorn app:app
🔸 Replace app:app if your file is named differently:

app.py file ➜ app:app

main.py file ➜ main:app

Format is: FILENAME:FLASK_APP_VARIABLE

✅ Step 3: Push Code to GitHub
Create a free GitHub account if you don’t have one.

Initialize git in your project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with yours.

✅ Step 4: Deploy on Render
Go to 👉 https://render.com

Sign in (you can use GitHub directly)

Click “New +” → “Web Service”

Connect your GitHub repo

Fill in these:

Name: anything

Environment: Python 3

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn app:app

Region: Closest to you

Click Create Web Service and Render will build & deploy it 🎉

✅ Step 5: DONE ✅
After a minute or so, your Flask app will be live on a public URL, like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://your-flask-app.onrender.com
Test it in any browser!

🚧 Bonus Tips
If you use .env file for secrets, use Render’s Environment Variables tab to add them manually.

If your app uses file uploads or databases, we can integrate those too.

Every time you git push, Render redeploys automatically!
